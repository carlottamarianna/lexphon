**ABSTRACT:**
This article addresses the questions of how and when lexical information influences phoneme
identification in a series of phoneme-monitoring experiments in which conflicting predictions of
autonomous and interactive models were evaluated. Strong facilitatory lexical effects
(reflected by large differences in detection latencies to targets in words and matched
nonwords) were found only when targets came after the uniqueness point of the
target-bearing word. Furthermore, no evidence was obtained for lexically mediated inhibition
on phoneme identification as predicted by the interactive activation model TRACE. These
results taken together point to strong limitations in the way in which lexical information can
affect the perception of unambiguous speech.
